information:

I live in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina, CTO of Machinalis, pragmatic programmer and part of the PyAr community (Python Argentina) for many years.

I have given several talks about python in the context of our community, and from the experience in Machinalis where the company has grown from a few people to more than 70 currently, I think there are some of my experiences that can enrich the community.

Passionate about reading, narrative and words. Of technology and also of nature.
